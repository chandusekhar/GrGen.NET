GrGen.NET v1.3 (2007-11-06)
---------------------------

This is the GrGen.NET system for graph rewriting.
Its core is the Graph Rewrite Generator, which turns declarative rewrite
specifications into .NET assemblies performing the rewrites.

The GrGen.NET system consists of the generator written in Java, a graph backend
written in C# and the .NET assemblies generated by the generator.


INSTALL
-------

You need the following system setup for GrGen.NET:
  - Microsoft .NET 2.0 or above
    OR Mono 1.2.2 or above
  - Java 1.5 or above

For Linux:
  - Unpack GrGenNET.tar.bz2 to a folder of your choice (referred to
    as <GrGenNETPath> in the following)
    Example (extracts files into GrGen.NET in your current directory):

      tar -xjf GrGenNET.tar.bz2

  - Edit the <GrGenNETPath>/bin/ycomp script by replacing "<GrGenNETPath>" by
    your chosen path.

For Windows:
  - Unpack GrGenNET.tar.bz2 to a folder of your choice (referred to as
    <GrGenNETPath> in the following)

  - Either set your computer path environment to include <GrGenNETPath>\bin
    or enter the following command in the command prompt:

      set PATH=<GrGenNETPath>\bin;%PATH%

    Of course you have to replace <GrGenNETPath> by your chosen path.
      
    ATTENTION: Do NOT add ""s around any part of the path, even if it
      contains spaces! Otherwise yComp, a graph visualisation tool, will not
      run out of GrShell!

  - Edit <GrGenNETPath>\bin\yComp.bat by replacing "<GrGenNETPath>" by
    your chosen path.


RUN
---

To run an example change into the appropriate example directory and execute
the GrShell with a .grs-file. Libraries are automatically generated from
the rule (.grg) and model (.gm) specification files if the
"new graph <grg-file>" command is used and any of these files changed or
the libraries do not exist, yet.

Example:
  - cd into <GrGenNETPath>/examples/Mutex
  - .NET: Run "GrShell Mutex10.grs"
    Mono: Run "mono <GrGenNETPath>/bin/GrShell.exe Mutex10.grs"

If you just need the libraries execute GrGen with a .grg-file.
Example:
  - .NET: Run "GrGen <GrGenNETPath>/examples/Mutex/Mutex.grg"
    Mono: Run "mono <GrGenNETPath>/bin/GrGen.exe 
               <GrGenNETPath>/examples/Mutex/Mutex.grg"

You can also generate source code, which you can include into your C#
projects directly. Call GrGen with the -keep option, which saves the
generated source code in a subfolder "tmpgrgen<number>".
Example:
  - .NET: Run "GrGen -keep <GrGenNETPath>/examples/Mutex/Mutex.grg"
    Mono: Run "mono <GrGenNETPath>/bin/GrGen.exe -keep
               <GrGenNETPath>/examples/Mutex/Mutex.grg"


TESTS
-----

The tests subdirectory contains an automated testbench used to check the
consistency of our GrGen.NET releases. You can run the testbench by executing
the "test.sh" shell script (for Windows you can use Cygwin).


KNOWN ISSUES
------------

The following issues are currently known.
Please try to avoid them until they are fixed.

  - GrShell does not handle tabs correctly.
  - The BaseGraph.Validate function is buggy.
  - The Mono compiler seems to hang on rules with very large patterns
    (~1000 graph elements).
