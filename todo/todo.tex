{\bf\Large The GrGen.NET ToDo-List}



\mysection{Frontend (Java):}
ToDo:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Annotions of anonymous nodes and edges do not work.
  \item In replace/modify-part {\tt typeof} does not work.
  \item Error detection for the {\tt return} statement is errornous.
  \item If the filename of a .grg-file does not conform with the name given along with the {\tt actions} keyword, an error is raised (which is just the right behaviour). However, the output file is genrated all the same, which should not happen.
  \item At test case should\_fail/ret\_001.grg:
  	The signature of the rule demands a type {\tt AB}.
	However, if you return a type {\tt C} (that is no subtype of {\tt AB}) no error is reported, which were the right behaviour.
\end{itemize}
